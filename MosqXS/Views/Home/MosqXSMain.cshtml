    <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
        <p class="col-sm-6 text-light">In 2019, the number of dengue cases in a given week reached an all-time high since 2015, at 664 cases in late June.  
        This has raised our concern as dengue fever can cause severe harm to families, taking loved ones lives or being a cause for alarm. </p>

<div class="d-block h-25 pt-5">
    <h1 class="text-center font-weight-bold" style="font-family:Century;">Why do we have this idea?</h1>
    <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
        <p class="col-6">
            We decided to create an actual product rather than just a website or mobile application, 
            which may be used to spread awareness of dengue, as we feel that just by doing so would not be enough. 
            This way, we can take an active role in reducing the risk of contracting dengue fever, rather than just a passive one.
            We started by doing research on various potential approaches to the issue. 
            These approaches were eventually narrowed down to be either repelling or attracting mosquitoes. 
            Research done shows that by tackling some of the mosquitoes senses, they can be attracted towards certain areas. 
            We intend to take advantage of this, and attract mosquitoes to the devices, away from people.
